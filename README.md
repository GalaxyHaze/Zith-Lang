A statically typed, compiled, general-purpose language. Zith proves memory safety at compile time
through **Node Resource Analysis (NRA)** — no garbage collector, no borrow checker, no runtime
overhead. The syntax stays clean; the compiler does the hard work.

---

## What Makes Zith Different

NRA tracks ownership, lending, and aliasing through five qualifiers — `lend`, `view`, `unique`,
`share`, and `belong` — without requiring lifetime annotations. Beyond memory safety, Zith ships a
large toolbox for domain-specific work: custom operators (`word`), scoped DSLs (`context`), structured
goto (`flow fn` / `marker` / `dock`), and first-class compile-time computation.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalaxyHaze/Zith.git
cd Zith
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
./build/zithc --help
```

Requires **CMake 3.15+** and a **C++23** compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 16+, or MSVC 19.35+).
LLVM 18+ is optional — without it, codegen is disabled but `check` and HIR emission still work.

**Hello, World:** ( is a place holder, until we can formalize macros correctly)

```zith
extern fn puts(msg: *char)

fn main() {
    puts("Hello, World!");
}
```

then the canonical way would be:

```zith
from std/io/console

fn main() {
    @println("Hello, World!");
}
```


```bash
./build/zithc run examples/hello-world.zith
```

## Language Overview

**Type System**

- Primitives: `u8`-`u128`, `i8`-`i128`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`, `void`
- Composite: `struct`, `component` (POD), `enum` (C-style, struct-backed, ADT), `union` (tagged & C-union hatch escape)
- Generics, `type` aliases, and pattern matching with `when`

**Memory Model (NRA)**

- `lend` — exclusive mutable borrow for the call
- `view` — read-only borrow
- `unique` — sole owner; value is consumed on assignment
- `share` — reference-counted, safe across scopes
- `belong` — declares that a field owns its pointee

**Functions**

- `fn` — regular function
- `const fn` — resolved entirely at compile time
- `flow fn` — structured goto with `marker` / `dock` / `jump` (no spaghetti, compiler-verified)
- `async fn` / `yield` — suspend/resume (parsed; semantic layer in progress)
- `raw fn` — opt out of NRA for C-interop

**Control Flow**

- `if` / `when` (pattern matching) / `for`
- `->` chain-flow operator for left-to-right pipelines

**Error Handling**

- `?T` optional, `T!` result — zero-cost, return-based
- `or` fallback chains, `fail` blocks, `with` / `catch`, `throw`
- `must` (debug panic) / `raw` (always unchecked)

**Extensibility (Experimental)**

- `word` — define custom infix, prefix, or suffix operators
- `context` — bundle words and macros into an activatable DSL scope
- `use` — bring a context or word into scope

## Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lexer / parser | **Working** | Full grammar including experimental syntax |
| Formatter (`zithc fmt`) | **Working** | Preserves all AST nodes including experimental |
| Type checking | **Working** | Structs, enums, generics, function calls |
| LLVM codegen | **Working** | x86-64 and WebAssembly targets |
| `fn`, `const fn`, `flow fn` | **Working** | |
| `struct`, `enum`, `union`, `component` | **Working** | |
| Primitive arithmetic and comparisons | **Working** | Including unsigned ops |
| `if` / `when` / `for` | **Working** | |
| `->` chain operator | **Working** | |
| Module imports (`import`, `from`, `export`) | **Working** | |
| `alias`, `type` | **Working** | |
| C interop (`extern fn`, `import ".h"`) | **Working** | |
| Field access (`.field`) | Semantic warning | Parses, HIR lowering not yet complete |
| Index access (`a[i]`) | Semantic warning | Parses, HIR lowering not yet complete |
| `is` / `as` | **Blocked (E2010)** | Parsed; sema rejects before HIR |
| `?` / `!` propagation / fallback | **Blocked (E2010)** | Parsed; sema rejects before HIR |
| `word` / `context` / `use` | **Blocked (E2010)** | Parsed; sema rejects before HIR |
| `macro` / `@macro` calls | Semantic warning | Parses; expansion not implemented |
| `async fn` / `yield` / `spawn` / `await` | Spec only | No compiler support yet |
| NRA pass | Spec only | Pipeline stub exists; analysis not implemented |
| `comptime` blocks | Spec only | No evaluation yet |
| `zithc test` / `zithc repl` / `zithc deps` | Stub | Returns "not implemented" |

> **E2010 (UnsupportedSyntax):** the compiler accepts these constructs syntactically but emits a
> hard semantic error if they appear in code. They will be unlocked as their HIR representation
> and type semantics are fully defined.
