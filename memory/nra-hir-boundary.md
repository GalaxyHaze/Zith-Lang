# HIR/NRA Implementation Playbook

Operational guide for future ByteAsk agents working on the HIR and NRA boundary in Zith. This
document describes the current source-tree contract: the pipeline order, where residual ownership
facts are stored, the pitfalls discovered in this session, the debugging workflow, and the
validation checklist that keeps the contract stable.

It intentionally does not update code, APIs, or existing documentation. When one of the referenced
implementation facts changes, update this playbook and the docs listed under "Docs That Must Stay
Aligned".

## Stable Pipeline Contract

The documented compiler pipeline is:

```text
source -> lex -> scan -> resolve(import/symbols) -> sema -> comptime/solve -> NTA/NRA -> HIR -> LLVM
```

The current `CompilationSession::runTo` execution order is:

```text
sema -> solve -> nra -> lower -> codegen/cache
```

`sema` builds the modern sema pipeline. `solve` currently creates the modern type table as a
conservative stub. `nra` accumulates `NraFacts` before lowering. `lower` runs `HirLowerModern`,
then runs the current HIR-based `comptime::Solver` as a compatibility pass after lowering. `codegen`
and `cache` run only for stages that require them.

The stable boundary is: the pre-HIR `NTA/NRA` pass accumulates residual ownership facts, and the
final HIR is ownership-free except for those residual side-table facts. Do not move the ownership
proof behind final lowering or invent HIR ownership nodes.

The `Stage` enum is explicit about the target order:

```cpp
Source, Lexed, Scanned, Imported, Resolved, TypeChecked,
Solved, NraResolved, HirLowered, CodegenReady, Cached
```

## Where Ownership Facts Live

- `NraFacts` is the pre-lowering residual ownership accumulator defined in
  `src/sema/nra-facts.hpp` and implemented in `src/sema/nra-facts.cpp`. It is created in
  `CompilationSession::nraStage()` before HIR lowering.
- `HirAttrs` is the parallel side-table owner defined in `src/hir/hir-attrs.hpp`. It attaches
  per-slot, per-call, and per-function facts to otherwise ownership-free HIR.
- `HirLowerModern` receives the facts as `const NraFacts *` through its constructor in
  `src/sema/hir-lower-modern.hpp`.
- `CompilationSession` keeps the facts in `mNraFacts` and exposes them through `nraFacts()`;
  do not replace that accessor without updating callers that inspect residual facts after HIR
  lowering.
- HIR expressions and function records stay free of ownership fields. No `HirMove`, `HirBorrow`, or
  `HirYield` node exists in the current tree. Programs without ownership must produce empty residual
  attribute tables.

The deterministic use-after-move slice currently implemented is `&local` and `@ptrOf(local)`:
`NraFacts::walkExpr` marks the resolved local as `knownAlive = false` when it sees those forms,
and `HirLowerModern::localSlot` publishes that as `HirConsumedState::Consumed`. Sema still owns the
`E4001` diagnostic; lowering only carries the residual fact. Receiver-by-value moves, call-site
move facts, and branch-sensitive alive/dead state are still outside this slice because the compact
`walkExpr` order is not branch/SSA aware.

## Known Pitfalls

- **Implicit return**: the implicit return value lives in the last `Expression` statement of the
  function body, not in `body.operands`. Treating the body node as `Return` or trusting empty
  `operands` misses forwarding facts and return equivalence.
- **Use-after-move facts are sema-side first**: `NraFacts` must not invent new diagnostics or move
  state. It echoes the logical moves already represented by `PerModuleSema::movedLocals_` into
  residual slot facts; otherwise the pass and sema can disagree about what a clean program contains.
- **Field/Arrow ownership**: for `Field` and `Arrow`, resolve ownership in this order: direct local
  first, then the `exprTypes` qualified type, then the qualified field type stored on the root
  local's struct type. For `Arrow`, descend through the pointee before looking up the field type.
- **Belong escape guard**: the old `index + 1U <= argument_locals.size()` guard blocked `belong`
  escape facts. Use the zero-based argument slot `index - 1U` and validate against
  `fact.argEscapes.size()`.
- **Sema lifetime**: keep `SemaPipeline` alive through lowering. Do not reset the semantic pipeline
  before NRA/HIR consume it.
- **No ownership HIR nodes**: HIR carries only lazy residual facts. Programs without ownership must
  have empty `HirAttrs` tables.
- **Build constraints**: the project compiles with `-Weverything -Werror` on Clang. Respect
  arena/`DynArray` ownership, avoid exceptions/RTTI, and do not leave unused params/members or NRVO
  warnings.
- **Formatting**: `fmt-check` can fail because of unrelated worktree files. Format only files you
  touched, then run the global check without reverting existing user changes.
- **Debug traces**: remove temporary `fprintf`/`std::cerr`/`std::cout` output before finishing and
  confirm with `rg -n "fprintf|std::cerr|std::cout"`.

## Debugging Workflow

Use focused test targets when iterating on this boundary:

```bash
cmake --build build -j --target test-hir-lower-modern test-memory-qualifiers test-codegen
```

Run the full suite before closing:

```bash
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Reproduce ownership diagnostics with `zithc check` because some NRA facts are
diagnosed during sema even though the residual table is constructed before HIR.

## Validation Checklist

- Build each touched target and the full test suite after changes.
- Run `zithc check` on a reproducer for the exact diagnostic being changed, both
  accepted and rejected forms.
- Verify HIR emission no longer contains ownership fields after lowering:
  `zithc build --emit hir` on a file with qualifiers.
- Verify programs without ownership still produce empty `HirAttrs`.
- Do not reset the semantic pipeline before NRA and HIR have consumed it.
