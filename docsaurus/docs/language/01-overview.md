# Language Guide

This section provides a comprehensive reference for the Zith programming language. It now includes a direct map of the prototype v2.0 language spec topics.

## Core Concepts


### [Spec Core Topics](./spec-core-topics.md)
Review the v2.0 architectural-spec topic map: NRM, ownership keywords, contexts, packs, ECS/scenes, intrinsics, and concurrency.

### [Syntax Basics](./syntax.md)
Learn the fundamental syntax of Zith including variables, types, and expressions.

### [Variables & Ownership](./variables.md)
Understand Zith's unique ownership model with `unique`, `share`, `view`, `lend`, and `extension` modifiers.

### [Type System](./types.md)
Explore Zith's static type system, primitive types, and type inference.

### [Control Flow](./control-flow.md)
Master conditionals, loops, and pattern matching in Zith.

### [Functions](./functions.md)
Learn about function declaration, parameters, return types, and advanced features.

### [Memory Management](./memory.md)
Deep dive into Zith's memory model, allocation, and safe memory handling.

### [Error Handling](./errors.md)
Handle errors gracefully with Zith's error handling mechanisms.

### [Modules & Organization](./modules.md)
Structure large projects with modules, imports, and visibility controls.

### [Generics](./generics.md)
Write reusable code with Zith's powerful generics system.

## Advanced Topics

For more advanced features, see the **[Advanced Topics](../advanced/01-overview.md)** section:

- Traits and type classes
- Spec-aligned ownership and NRM deep dives
- Advanced generics
- Metaprogramming
- Macros
- Unsafe operations
- Raw pointers

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Variables | `let x: i32 = 5;` |
| Functions | `fn add(a: i32, b: i32): i32 { a + b }` |
| Ownership | `unique`, `share`, `view`, `lend`, `extension` modifiers |
| Control Flow | `if`, `for`, `while`, `match` |
| Memory | Manual with safety guarantees |
| Errors | Result types and exceptions |
