## 9. Control Flow

> **Implementation status:** `if`/`else`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, and loop labels are **working**.
> `for` is the canonical loop: `for { ... }`, `for (cond) { ... }`, the comma-based 3-clause form,
> and duck-typed `for (x in iterable)` are **working**. Labels can target any of these forms and
> loop bodies can lower to the same CFG machinery as the
> old `while`. `while` still works but emits a deprecation warning (`W1008`) pointing at
> `for (cond) { }`. The literal range forms (`0..4`) are not implemented yet. `when` pattern
> matching is **working**, including equality, boolean, guard islands, range, pattern
> alternatives, and tagged-union type-narrowing arms. Cases are comma-separated and the
> canonical form writes the body immediately after the condition islands. The legacy `~>`
> marker still compiles but emits `W1008`. `state` declarations, `dock` calls, and `jump`
> terminating transfers are **working** and compile to direct LLVM `musttail` calls. The old
> `flow fn`/`marker`/TLS-blob model is removed. See [impl-status.md](impl-status.md).

### 9.1 Syntax Rules

Parentheses `()` are mandatory on every control structure's condition except function calls. Logical operators use English keywords. Bitwise operators use standard symbols followed by `.`:

```zith
if (x > 0 and y < 10) { ... }
if isTrue() and (x > 5) { ... }
let mask = a &. b |. c ^. d;
```

Boolean negation is written as `not`. `!` is not accepted as a prefix unary
operator in this iteration and remains reserved for a future postfix form:

```zith
if (not (x > 0)) { ... }
```

### 9.2 `for`

```zith
for { ... }                                     // infinite
for (i in iterable) { @println(i); }            // user iterator with next(self): ?T
for (i = 0), (i < 10), (i += 1) { ... }         // init / cond / step
for (v in range(0, 100)) { @println(v); }       // over a generator

// Destructured group with fallback
let r = for ([acc, i]: i32), (i in 0..n) { acc *= i + 1 } or 0;
```

Labels use `name: for ...` / `name: while ...` and are stored on the loop
expression. `break name;` and `continue name;` target that loop. Without a
label they target the innermost active loop. An unknown or duplicate active
label is rejected by semantic analysis. Labeled exits run cleanup for every
loop between the current innermost loop and the target:

```zith
outer: for (...) {                               // labeled loop
    for (...) {
        break outer;                             // exits the outer loop
        continue outer;                          // continues the outer loop
    }
}
```

> If the loop body may never run, its return value is deduced as optional, unless `or` collapses it to a non-optional value.

> The init/cond/step form accepts comma-separated, parenthesized expressions, such as `for (i = 0), (i < 10), (i += 1)`, or the flat alternative `for (i = 0, i < 10, i += 1)`. The iterator form expects a value whose type exposes `next(self)`. The canonical `next` returns `?T`: `null` is the iteration end and `Some(element)` is a loop value. For iterators that need to yield optional elements, `next(self): ??T` binds the loop variable as `?T`, so a `null` element is a valid iteration value and only the outer `None` ends the loop. `for` calls `next` once per iteration, exits when the result is the outer `None`, and otherwise binds the inner payload as the loop variable.

```zith
struct Range {
    current: i32,
    limit: i32,
    fn next(var self): ?i32 {
        if (self->current >= self->limit) {
            return null;
        }
        let value = self->current;
        self->current = self->current + 1;
        return value;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let range = Range { current: 0, limit: 3 };
    for (x in range) {
        println(x);
    }
}
```

The tagged-union `{ T, End }` protocol remains accepted during migration, but the optional
protocol is canonical and should be used for new iterators.

### 9.3 Chain Flow (`->`)

The `->` operator pipes output left to right. The previous value is available as `..`, and tags capture values for later use. `!` and `?` propagate out of the chain normally. Precedence is left-to-right and lower than function calls.

```zith
getData() -> process(..) -> save(..);

getData()
    -> raw:    parse(..)
    -> parsed: validate(..)!       // ! propagates out of the chain
    -> connectDb()
    -> save(parsed);

// Inline block
readFile("data.bin")
    -> { let h = parse_header(..); validate(h)! }
    -> process_body(..);

// Comma sub-chain -- f1 and f2 receive foo's value but do NOT advance the chain
foo(), f1(..), f2(..) -> f3(..);

// Parenthesized sub-chain -- this one does advance inside the sub-chain
// But don't affect the main chain
foo(), ( f1(..) -> f2() ) -> f3(..);
         ^                      ^
         |                      |
         foo                    foo
```

> Comma sub-chains are useful for side effects, such as logging or validation, without disrupting the main data flow.

### 9.4 `state` Functions & State Machines

A `state` function declares one state in a machine. `dock` starts a machine and evaluates to
its eventual return value. `jump` terminates the current state and tail-calls the next state.
Every state in one machine shares the same return type, while parameter lists may differ
between states. The return type drives machine grouping. Each transition validates arity and
argument types against its individual target. LLVM `tailcc` plus `musttail` lets transitions
between different signatures still compile to direct, stackless calls.

- **`state`**: `state Name(params): ReturnType { ... }`. Each state is a normal function body
  and may use module/global state and ordinary locals.
- **`dock`**: `dock Start(args)` is an expression. It calls a state and returns the value
  produced by `return` in the final state.
- **`state(params): ReturnType` value**: a real state declaration can be stored in a value
  with the matching `state(params): ReturnType` signature, and `dock` accepts that value with
  the same argument and return-type checks as a direct state call.
- **`jump`**: `jump Next(args);` is terminating and only valid inside a state. It may target a
  state with a different parameter list from the same machine, and it lowers to `musttail tailcc`
  followed by `ret`.
- **`return`**: `return value;` inside a state completes the machine and supplies the result
  to the originating `dock` call.

```zith
state Count(n: i32): i32 {
    if (n == 0) {
        return n;
    }
    jump Count(n - 1);
}

fn main(): i32 {
    let result = dock Count(3);
    return result;
}
```

Transitions never grow the stack on targets with backend `musttail` support. All states in a
machine use LLVM `tailcc`, including ordinary `dock` calls into them, so transitions between
different parameter lists keep one consistent ABI. The compiler diagnoses unsupported targets
instead of silently falling back to a marker runtime.

```zith
state Machine(n: i32): i32 {
    return n;
}

fn main(): i32 {
    let S: state(i32): i32 = Machine;
    return dock S(42);
}
```

### 9.5 Scope Cleanup (`defer` / `drop`)

`defer expr;` and `defer { ... }` are implemented in the `Zith--` subset.
`defer expr;` registers one cleanup expression. `defer { ... }` registers the
whole body as a cleanup-only block that does not produce a value. Statements in
a deferred body run in written order, while separate `defer` statements run in
reverse registration order when their nearest lexical block exits.

A `defer` may capture bindings declared later in the same lexical block. The
sema defers typing of the deferred body until the block's direct bindings are
known, and lowering emits deferred cleanup after those slots are created. If a
`return`, `break`, `continue`, `jump`, or nested control-flow exit before the
binding can leave the block while the capture is still uninitialized, the
compiler rejects it:

```zith
fn main(): i32 {
    defer cleanup(v);   // ok when `v` is initialized before every exit
    var v: i32 = 1;
    return 0;
}
```

- `defer expr;` registers a cleanup expression for the enclosing block.
- Expressions run when the block exits, in reverse registration order.
- They run on normal fallthrough and across `return`, `break`, `continue`, and
  `state` `jump` transitions.
- `return value;` evaluates the value first. Deferred bodies run immediately
  before the terminator.
- A `defer` body may not itself contain `return`, `break`, `continue`, or
  `jump`.

Inside a loop, cleanup runs each time the loop body exits, including a
`break` or `continue`. `drop` remains a reserved keyword and is still a
roadmap candidate: planned as the deterministic per-owner cleanup hook through
the same reverse-order mechanism, but not yet implemented. Anything stronger,
such as `errdefer` or `drop` interactions with borrows, is kept out of the
current iteration. The implementation plan is in `docs/plans/defer-drop.md`.
