## 9. Control Flow

### 9.1 Syntax Rules

Parentheses `()` are mandatory on every control structure's condition except function calls. Logical operators use English keywords; bitwise operators use standard symbols followed by `.`:

```zith
if (x > 0 and y < 10) { ... }
if isTrue() and (x > 5) { ... }
let mask = a &. b |. c ^. d;
```

### 9.2 `for`

```zith
for { ... }                                     // infinite
for (i in 0..=9) { @println(i); }               // inclusive range
for (i in 0..9)  { @println(i); }               // exclusive range
for (i = 0), (i < 10), (i += 1) { ... }         // init / cond / step
for (v in range(0, 100)) { @println(v); }       // over a generator

// Destructured group with fallback
let r = for ([acc, i]: i32), (i in 0..n) { acc *= i + 1 } or 0;
```

> If the loop body may never run, its return value is deduced as optional — unless `or` collapses it to a non-optional value.

> The init/cond/step form accepts comma-separated, parenthesized expressions — `for (i = 0), (i < 10), (i += 1)` — or the flat alternative, `for (i = 0, i < 10, i += 1)`.

### 9.3 Chain Flow (`->`)

The `->` operator pipes output left to right. The previous value is available as `..`, and tags capture values for later use. `!` and `?` propagate out of the chain normally. Precedence is left-to-right and lower than function calls.

```zith
getData() -> process(..) -> save(..);

getData()
    -> raw:    parse(..)
    -> parsed: validate(..)!       // ! propagates out of the chain
    -> connectDb()
    -> save(parsed);

// Inline block
readFile("data.bin")
    -> { let h = parse_header(..); validate(h)! }
    -> process_body(..);

// Comma sub-chain -- f1 and f2 receive foo's value but do NOT advance the chain
foo(), f1(..), f2(..) -> f3(..);

// Parenthesized sub-chain -- this one does advance inside the sub-chain
// But don't affect the main chain
foo(), ( f1(..) -> f2() ) -> f3(..);
         ^                      ^
         |                      |
         foo                    foo
```

> Comma sub-chains are useful for side effects — logging, validation — without disrupting the main data flow.

### 9.4 `flow` Functions & Markers

A `flow fn` lets you write control flow using **markers**, **docks**, and **jumps**:

- **`marker`**: A named block of code, hoisted to the top of the `flow fn`. Acts as a label. Receives values via `jump`.
- **`dock`**: A block that grants permission to use `jump`. You can use `if`, `when`, loops — anything inside a `dock`.
- **`jump`**: The transfer operator. Must always be inside a `dock`. Sends values to a target `marker` and transfers control.

```zith
flow fn run(data: Stream): void {
    marker Process(chunk: Chunk, count: i32) {
        transform(chunk);
        // count carries over from the last jump unless you update it
    }

    for ( i = 0, item in data ) {
        dock {                          // dock grants jump permission
            if (item.isValid()) {
                jump Process(item, i);  // transfer to marker
            }
        }
        i += 1;
    }
}

// Global marker — usable from any flow fn
marker ContextSwitch(next: TaskId) {
    saveRegisters();
    loadTask(next);
}

// never: the return point is not altered — no resumption to protect
flow fn scheduler(): never { ... }
```

#### Marker Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Hoisting | Markers are lifted to the top of the `flow fn`. Normal execution skips over them. |
| Scope | Markers cannot see outer variables or declare their own locals. |
| Arguments | Stored in a `thread_local` blob. Values persist between jumps unless you update them. |
| Input from dock | Markers receive values via `jump` from any `dock` in the same `flow fn`. |
| Global markers | May call regular functions, but not `flow` functions — unless the target is `never`. The `never` exception exists because a `never` flow function never alters the return point — there is no resumption to protect. If it did alter the return point, it would corrupt the state. |

#### Stackful vs Stackless

Markers are **stackless** by default — can't create local variables. Opt into **stackful** with the `stackful` modifier. Before the jump, all local variables are cleaned. The following rules apply:

- **Values from outside** (came via `dock`): always valid — the caller owns them.
- **Local values**: never allowed — they would dangle after cleanup.

```zith
flow fn run(data: Stream): void {
    stackful marker Process(chunk: Chunk) {
        let buffer = allocate(chunk.size);  // local — dropped before jump
        jump transform(buffer);
        // only chunk crosses the jump (it came from outside)
    }
}
```
