Zith supports manual `extern fn` bindings on every target. Native builds which find libclang also
support a restricted, automatic C-header import path.

For Zith-style binders that need normal module, overload, and method semantics,
keep the full Zith signature on the left and put the C linker symbol on the right:

```zith
struct Window {}

pub fn createWindow(self: lend Sdl, title: *char, x: i32, y: i32,
                    width: i32, height: i32, flags: u32): ?*Window = extern SDL_CreateWindow;
pub fn destroy(self: lend Window): void = extern SDL_DestroyWindow;
```

Receiver binders must live in an `implement` block so method calls like
`window.destroy()` resolve through the owner type:

```zith
implement Window {
    pub fn destroy(self: lend Window): void = extern SDL_DestroyWindow;
}
```

The right-hand identifier must be a plain identifier. The compiler emits only an
external C symbol declaration. It does not create a Zith body. This lets a normal
`c/` module expose opaque SDL handles as Zith structs and attach thin methods to
them without relying on the C header importer or generating C shims.

### 18.1 Automatic Binding via `.h`

Native builds with libclang can import a `.h` file. The importer exposes supported external C
functions directly, preserving their variadic status. It does not generate Zith source.

```zith
import "mylib.h";

// Supported functions from mylib.h are available by their C linkage name.
my_function();
```

Only C ABI headers are accepted. `.hpp` files report that C++ headers are unsupported. Object-like
macros whose replacement is exactly one scalar literal are imported as constants. Function-like
and string macros, globals, bitfields, packed or anonymous records, flexible arrays, and other
non-representable layouts are not imported. A single unsupported declaration or macro is skipped
rather than failing the whole header. The importer records the reason in `skippedFunctions` so the
rest of the file stays available. Use manual `extern fn` for APIs outside this surface and for all
builds without libclang, including WASM and cross builds.

### 18.1.1 Object-Like Macro Constants

An object-like macro defined in the imported header expands to a single scalar literal and becomes
a module constant. The value comes from the macro replacement token itself. There is no external C
evaluation. Zith imports `true`/`false` as `bool`, `'x'` as `char`, unsuffixed integers as `i32`,
unsuffixed floats as `f64`, and the known suffixes `i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64`/`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`
/`isize`/`usize` or `f`/`F` float suffixes when the value fits the target type.

```zith
import "constants.h";

fn main(): i32 {
    let answer: i32 = ANSWER;   // #define ANSWER 42
    let ratio: f64 = RATIO;     // #define RATIO 1.5
    return 0;
}
```

Colliding with any symbol already visible in the module is a duplicate declaration error. Macros
that expand to expressions, strings, or unsupported values are skipped, not imported.

### 18.1.2 Variadic C Functions

Variadic declarations use `...` as the final token of an `extern fn` parameter list. The fixed
parameters are type-checked normally. The variadic tail accepts any number of arguments and
reaches the native ABI as a variadic call.

```zith
extern fn printf(fmt: *char, ...): i32

fn main(): i32 {
    printf("n=%d\n", 7);
    return 0;
}
```

A non-`extern` function cannot declare `...`, and the tail must be the last element of the
parameter list. Declarations produced by the C header importer carry the same variadic flag into
resolution, HIR, and LLVM.

At a variadic call site the compiler applies the C default argument promotions to the variadic
tail: `f32` is widened to `f64`, and `bool`/`char`/small integer arguments are widened to `i32`.
Fixed parameters keep their declared ABI types.

String and character literals decode the C-like escape set (`\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\0`, `\\`, `\'`,
`\"`, `\#`, and `\xHH`) before reaching LLVM, so `printf("v=%d\n", 42)` prints a real newline.
`\#` produces a literal `#` (useful as an escape hatch if string interpolation is added later).
Unknown escape sequences are rejected with `E0001` at the literal's span.

`char` literals such as `'B'` are typed as `char`, and `... as char` conversions are accepted.
Plain C `char` parameters and results import as Zith `char`.

| C type | Imported Zith type |
|---|---|
| `void`, `_Bool`, integers, floats | ABI-width primitive equivalent |
| `T*`, `const T*` | Nullable pointer `?*T`, preserving pointee constness |
| `T[N]`, `char[20]` (parameters) | Pointer to `T` / opaque pointer after C array decay |
| `va_list` | The decayed `struct __va_list_tag *` pointer carried by the function type |
| `int (*)(...)` (parameters) | Opaque pointer; callable through an existing C pointer value |
| simple records and enums | Named foreign type; simple records additionally carry verified layout and fields |

Because a C pointer imports as `?*T` (see
[8.1.1](08-error-handling.md#811-c-pointers-are-t)), reinterpreting one is written `as ?*T`.
`as *T` is rejected with `E3003` so the null case cannot be dropped silently. Passing a pointer
the other way needs no cast: any `*T` or `?*T` is accepted for a C `void*` parameter.

```zith
import "stdlib.h"

fn main(): i32 {
    let cell: ?*i32 = malloc(64) as ?*i32;
    free(cell);                             // ?*i32 -> void*, no cast
    var local: i32 = 7;
    free(&local);                           // *i32  -> void*, no cast
    return 0;
}
```

Simple records passed or returned **by value** import only when libclang proves their layout for
the configured target triple and sysroot. The supported field subset is scalar types, plain C
pointers, and nested simple records that also pass validation. The binder records each field's
name, offset, and type plus the record's total size and alignment, and the lowerer materialises
the same fields as a Zith struct so the LLVM structural type matches the C ABI.

Records are rejected when any of these conditions apply:

```text
bitfields
explicit packing or alignment attributes
anonymous records or anonymous fields
flexible array members
`long double`
`__int128`
not directly addressable target layout (incomplete or non-constant size)
```

An unsupported record used as a fixed by-value parameter or return type is skipped with an
explicit reason in `skippedFunctions`. It never reaches codegen with an unverified layout.
Pointers to records continue to import as opaque nullable pointers without requiring a record
layout, because no value ABI needs to be proven for a pointer.

The project may configure C parsing and linking in `ZithProject.toml`:

```toml
[ffi]
include_dirs = ["vendor/include"]
c_source_dirs = ["vendor/c", "src/native"]
library_dirs = ["vendor/lib"]
libraries = ["mylib"]
defines = ["MYLIB_FEATURE=1"]
```

`c_source_dirs` is scanned recursively for `*.c` files and compiles each one into
`cache/c-obj/<target>/...` before the native link step. Only roots declared there or through the
repeatable `--c-source-dir <DIR>` flag participate in C compilation. `-I` does not imply source
discovery.

`-I`, `-D`, `-L`, `-l`, and `--c-source-dir` add command-line values after project values.
Library names are validated and linked without passing a shell command string.

Native builds compile `*.c` through embedded `libtcc` when it is available. CMake first looks for
an existing `libtcc.h`/`libtcc.a`, including the `ZITH_TCC_ROOT` prefix. When none is found and
`ZITH_TCC_FETCH` is enabled, the configuration fetches and builds TinyCC 0.9.27 for the local host
as a static, PIC library. Disable fetching with `-DZITH_TCC_FETCH=OFF` to keep using the external C
compiler driver.

#### System C headers

System C headers resolve without any `-I` flag. On startup the compiler probes libclang once per
`(target triple, sysroot)` pair to discover the toolchain's default include directories, so
`import "stdint.h"` works out of the box. The clang resource directory (containing compiler-built
headers such as `stddef.h`) is found during CMake configuration from the LLVM package and pushed
both to the probe and to every header parse. Builds without libclang fall back to `/usr/include`
and `/usr/local/include` when they exist.

```zith
import "stdint.h";
```

These directories are searched **last**. Stdlib roots, `-I` roots, the workspace root, and the
importing file's own directory all take precedence, so a project-local `stdint.h` shadows the
system one. Pass `--no-system-includes` to disable the behaviour entirely. Imports then resolve
only from explicitly configured roots. The discovered directories are part of the artifact cache
key, so changing them does not reuse stale cached modules.

Only C spellings with a `.h` extension resolve this way. Extensionless C++ names such as
`cstdint` are not supported.

### 18.2 Manual Binding with Semantic Annotation

Override or supplement auto-generated bindings to attach Zith-specific semantics:

```zith
// Equivalent declarations — malloc is a C function (no namespace)
// bindToC is subject to Zith namespace rules
fn bindToC = extern 'C' malloc(size: u64): unique opaque;
extern 'C' malloc(size: u64): unique opaque;   // same thing, no namespace alias
```

### 18.3 External (No Header)

For assembly routines, headerless libraries, or code deliberately outside the project:

```zith
// The linker resolves this; the compiler has no information about the function
fn bindTo = extern someAsmRoutine(x: u64): u64;
```

### 18.4 Exposing Zith to C

```zith
extern 'C' fn my_function(x: i32): i32 {
    x * 2
}
// Generates a C-compatible symbol, callable from C as an ordinary function
```
