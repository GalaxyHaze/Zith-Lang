# ZITH Language Specification
**Draft v0.9 — 2026**

> Zith is a statically typed systems programming language with a small, composable core and a large toolbox for domain-specific work. It proves memory safety at compile time without a garbage collector or borrow checker.

## Introduction

Zith gives you full control with a minimal & clean syntax — you don't have to choose between verbose but safe or readable but slow. Its memory model, Node Resource Analysis (NRA), proves ownership and lifetime safety using five keywords: `lend`, `view`, `unique`, `share`, and `belong` — plus a `default` (no keyword) modifier.

Beyond memory safety, Zith has a general-purpose core with a much larger toolbox: markers, contexts (DSLs), words (custom operators), comptime. You choose when to use them. Zith also follows the **Rule of Three**: "if a function needs more than three specialized tools, something went wrong."

This document is a draft of language specification, currently v0.9. It serves three audiences: developers learning Zith for the first time, contributors working on the `zithc` compiler, and tooling authors building editors, linters, or other infrastructure around the language.

### Notation used in this document

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `?T` | Optional type — `T` or `null` ([§8.1](08-error-handling.md#81-failable-types)) |
| `T!` | Result type — `T` or an error ([§8.1](08-error-handling.md#81-failable-types)) |
| `?` / `!` (postfix) | Unwrap an optional / result, propagating or falling back ([§8.3](08-error-handling.md#83-propagation--fallback)) |
| `@name` | Compiler intrinsic or macro invocation ([§11.3](11-comptime.md#113-reflection), [§15](15-macros.md)) |
| `#name` | Variable or field attribute, e.g. `#thread_local` or `#volatile` |
| `::` | Scope resolution — reach past a shadowed name ([§2.3](02-module-system.md#23-namespace-access--scope-resolution)) |

## 1. Overview & Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Who Zith Is For

If you are looking for just a 'new' language, clone or 'normal', so Zith is not for you. Zith was created for people starting to learn or open-minded, to discover new ways to think and structure your code, while having a powerful, readable, safe & expressive language.

### 1.2 Our Philosophy

Zith aims to be small and stable at its core — covering everyday needs — while offering a large kit that helps in specific domains where most languages need a lot of tricks to work.
The compiler is a copilot: it gives you the tools, and you build the systems.

| Everyday | Domain-specific |
|---|---|
| `struct`, `fn`, `lend`, `view`, `trait`, `interface` | `marker`, `dock`, `jump` — for Games, State Machine, OS & embedded |
| `?T`, `T!`, `or` | `context`, `word` — for DSLs and APIs |
| `when`, `for`, `->` | `async` — for data pipelines |

### 1.3 Design Goals

- Expressive, minimal syntax that favors readability without sacrificing power.
- Memory safety via Node Resource Analysis (NRA).
- Composable behavior through traits, capabilities, and interfaces.
- Static, zero-overhead error handling with rich recovery semantics.
- Compile-time computation (`comptime`) as a first-class feature.
- Low-level control — flow functions, markers — without sacrificing safety in everyday code.
- Extensibility through words and macros, ideally scoped inside contexts rather than polluting the global namespace.

### 1.4 Context-Bound Extensibility (Best Practice)

Macros and words should ideally live inside a `context` block. Activating them globally is possible but discouraged — the same code smell as `using namespace std;` in C++.

```zith
// Preferred
use SQL {
    // SQL words and macros active only here
}

// Discouraged
use SQL;   // pollutes the rest of the file
```

### 1.5 Compilation Pipeline

The `zithc` compiler follows a multi-stage pipeline:

```
source -> lex -> scan -> resolve(import/symbols) -> sema -> comptime -> NRA -> HIR -> LLVM
```
> Note: when you compile a library, after LLVM it outputs `.zirl` (Zith Intermediate Representation Library).

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| `source` | Receive arguments from CLI, load the file |
| `lex` | Tokenize the file into a `TokenStream` |
| `scan` | Find top-level declarations from the token stream |
| `resolve` | Resolve imported symbols, report duplicates |
| `sema` | Semantic analysis — name resolution, type checking, visibility |
| `comptime` | Generic instantiation, macro expansion, `comptime` evaluation |
| `NRA` | Apply NRA to ensure memory safety |
| `HIR` | Build High-level IR — desugared, typed, NRA-validated |
| `LLVM` | Code generation via the LLVM backend |

`.zirl` files serve as cache and distribution format for compiled libraries — no headers needed, OS-agnostic, and you choose static or dynamic linking at the client side. Distribute once, link however the consumer prefers.
