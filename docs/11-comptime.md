## 11. Comptime

> **Implementation status:** `comptime` blocks and reflection intrinsics are **spec-only**.
> `const` bindings parse correctly but are not evaluated at compile time yet.
> See [impl-status.md](impl-status.md).

Comptime covers compile-time computation: reflection, type manipulation, and `const` blocks.

### 11.1 Comptime Bindings


```zith
const counter: mut = 0;
counter += 1;   // valid at compile time
// counter += input().nextI32();   // COMPILE ERROR: frozen at runtime
```

### 11.2 `const` Blocks

A `const { ... }` block executes its contents at compile time. Every value inside must be computable at compile time — if anything depends on runtime input, the compiler reports an error.

`const fn` functions resolve entirely at compile time and **must** be called inside a `const` block or assigned to a `const` binding; they cannot be called at runtime.

```zith
const result {
    let x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    x + y   // evaluated at compile time
};

import assets/data.json as Data;
const fn processJson(data: []char): JsonValue { ... }
const parsed = processJson(Data);  // runs at compile time
```

> Some macros and functions are overloaded to run at compile time; a compile-time `throw` halts compilation and displays the error message — equivalent to `static_assert` in other languages.

### 11.3 Reflection

Use `@` intrinsics to inspect types at compile time:

```zith
// Iterate the fields of a struct
for ( field in @fields MyStruct ) {
    @println("{}: {}", field.name, field.type);
}

// Check a type's kind
let isPrim = (T is @primitive);    // bool, i32, f64, etc.
let isStr  = (T is @struct);       // struct
let isComp = (T is @component);    // component
let isUn   = (T is @union);        // union
let isEn   = (T is @enum);         // enum

// Inspect field visibility
for ( field in @fields MyStruct ) {
    @println("{}: {}", field.name, field.visibility);  // pub, mod, private
}

// Check nullability
let nullable = (T is @nullable);   // ?T
```

### 11.4 Type Manipulation

> *This section is relevant for tooling authors and compiler contributors.*

You can create a type and modify it before it is "finalized":

```zith
// Create a new type
type Custom = @struct;

// Add fields -- allowed while the type is not yet returned or instantiated
@appendField Custom, x: i32;
@appendField Custom, y: f32;

// Remove a field
@removeField Custom, x;

// Add methods
@appendMethod Custom, fn distance(self): f32 { sqrt(self.x*self.x + self.y*self.y) }

// The type is "done" once it's returned or instantiated
let p: Custom = Custom { x: 1, y: 2.0 };

// Primitive aliases are IMMUTABLE -- they have no fields to modify
type Celsius = i32;
@appendField Celsius, x: i32;  // COMPILE ERROR: type is 'done' (primitive)
```

> A type built via `@struct` is "done" the moment it is returned or instantiated. Until then, `@appendField`, `@removeField`, and `@appendMethod` are available. Passing the type to a generic function also counts as "done."
>
> A type created with `type` (e.g. `type Celsius = i32`) is a primitive alias — it has no fields to modify and is always immutable. You can still add methods via `implement`, but you cannot `@appendField` or `@removeField`.
