# `soon/thread` Thread Library For Zith--

Status: drawing

Zith-- has no thread surface. The `c/` tree has no thread binding, `stdlib/`
has no thread module, and the native, VM v2, and WASM backends disagree about
what a thread even is. The full-Zith thread plan (`fork`, `merge`, `revoke`,
`spawn`) is spec-only and depends on the ownership type system that Zith-- does
not have. This drawing records a thread library for Zith-- that is ordinary
runtime code: the compiler sees only ordinary functions, traits, and results,
and adds no ownership rule for threads. The surface is `spawn(entry)` to build
a `Job` blueprint, `job.unbounded(args)` to launch it, and a `ThreadBackend`
trait with a default `Thread` implementation. This drawing fixes the backend
protocol, the handle lifecycle, the sharing wrappers, and the error channel.

Size: module, the standard-library thread surface.

## Current Facts

- Zith-- has no `fork`, `merge`, `revoke`, or `spawn`. All four are `Spec only`
  for full Zith in `docs/impl-status.md`, and `docs/Zith--.md` does not mention
  threads at all.
- No thread binding exists in `stdlib/c/` or `stdlib/std/`, and there is no
  `stdlib/soon/thread`. The native backend links libc but binds no `pthread`
  call. The VM v2 backend accepts a validated extern set, so a new thread
  operation needs a VM handler. WASM has no `wasi_thread_spawn`, so the browser
  backend cannot start a real thread today.
- Zith-- has no ownership type system for threads. It rejects `share`,
  `unique`, and `belong` with `E2010` and keeps only `lend` and `view`. A
  library that moves data into a thread therefore relies on runtime discipline,
  not a compiler rule.
- Zith-- has no closures with captures. Only anonymous `fn(...)` literals
  without capture exist, so an entry cannot close over caller state. Launch
  arguments must be passed explicitly.
- An entry may be a plain function or a state machine. `state`, `dock`, and
  `jump` work. A function value `fn(A): R` can be stored in a struct field and
  called through it, so a `Job` can hold its entry as a field. Only concrete
  non-generic function types are exercised today.
- `defer` runs on every lexical exit, including `return`, `break`, `continue`,
  and `jump`. Zith-- has no destructors, so cleanup is an explicit `destroy`
  call or a `defer`.
- `Result<T, E>` is the canonical failable return. The `T!` failable form is
  outside Zith--.
- A macro is invoked as `@name(args)` and takes a block only as an ordinary
  argument, so the synchronization sugar is `@sync(val, { ... })`. The
  trailing-block form `@sync(val) { ... }` is not accepted and reports a macro
  arity error.
- The `soon/io` executor drawing builds its worker pool on top of this module,
  so this thread surface is the lower layer.

## Proposed Surface

Exact declaration syntax and error type names are illustrative.

```zith
import soon/thread as th

fn worker(ctx: th.Context): i32 {
    ctx.done(7);
    7
}

fn main() {
    let backend = th.Thread.new();
    let job = backend.spawn(worker);      // blueprint, does not launch
    let handle: th.ThreadHandle<i32> = job.unbounded(ctx);
    let result: Result<i32, th.ThreadError> = handle.merge();
}
```

`Thread` is the default backend and implements the `ThreadBackend` trait.
Other backends are explicit values. `spawn(entry)` builds a `Job` blueprint and
does not start a thread. `job.unbounded(args)` launches the work and returns a
`ThreadHandle<R>`, where `R` is the entry's return type. The launch returns
`Result<ThreadHandle<R>, ThreadError>` so a backend that cannot start a thread
reports `ThreadError.Unsupported` instead of trapping.

The entry is a concrete, non-generic function that receives one explicit
context argument. The context type is shared by every thread of one backend.
The context is the runtime's, not a captured environment, because Zith-- has no
captures.

## The Backend Protocol

`ThreadBackend` is a trait. It names the ability to build a blueprint and to
launch it, and it is the seam that lets the native, VM v2, and WASM backends
implement the same surface. `Thread` is the default implementation and is
selected when the caller does not name a backend.

The backend is an explicit value, not ambient global state. A program that
needs a specific backend names it and passes it in. When a backend cannot
provide real threads, `job.unbounded` returns `ThreadError.Unsupported` and the
caller decides whether to fall back to a blocking call.

## Blueprint And Handles

`Job` is a reusable description of work. It holds the entry and nothing else,
because Zith-- has no captures. Launch arguments are supplied at the launch
site. A blueprint may be launched more than once.

Two handle kinds are distinct:

- `ThreadHandle<T>` is the mergeable handle. `merge()` blocks the calling
  thread, consumes the handle, and returns the entry's result. It is the same
  single-consumer value the full-Zith `merge` keyword consumes.
- A monitoring handle tracks a launched execution without consuming a result.
  It is not consumed by `merge`. Its exact type and method set remain open.

The first cut ships only `job.unbounded(args)`. A bounded launch and its
completion and resource-release rules are a documented library rule, not a
compiler rule, and are deferred.

An unconsumed `ThreadHandle<T>` at scope exit is implicitly detached. Detach
means the runtime stops tracking the thread and never destroys the handle.
Because Zith-- has no ownership enforcement, the runtime does not fail an
unconsumed handle. An explicit `detach()` method is deferred.

## Sharing Wrappers

Zith-- has no compiler-enforced sharing, so the library supplies two runtime
wrappers:

- `Share<T>` lets several threads read or update one value through explicit
  methods. Access is by method, not by field.
- `Revokable<T>` is a reference whose access the owner may revoke. A failed
  access returns `Result<T, ThreadError>` with the `Revoked` variant. The owner
  revokes without destroying the value or terminating the child.

These are library runtime wrappers, not the full-Zith revocable type qualifier.
ADR-0034 fixes the full-Zith spelling as a `'` sigil before the type, with no
source-level `Revokable<T>` wrapper. Zith-- has no such qualifier, so the
library wrapper is the only spelling available in the subset. The two are
different mechanisms that share a word, and the drawing keeps them apart.

## Synchronization Sugar

A lock and unlock pair is expressible with a macro and `defer`:

```zith
macro sync(val: identifier, body: block) {
    val.lock();
    defer val.unlock();
    body;
}

@sync(mutex, { counter = counter + 1; });
```

The block must be an ordinary argument, so the call is `@sync(val, { ... })`.
The trailing-block form `@sync(val) { ... }` is not part of the macro call
grammar and fails with an arity error. Supporting that form would need a parser
change and is out of scope here.

A `raw` macro does not rescue the trailing-block spelling. A raw macro is
invoked the same way, `@sync(val)`, and its body is spliced as statements. The
splice runs before the following block, and the `defer` it introduces is
scoped to the macro expansion, so `val.unlock()` runs before the following
block starts. The block then runs unlocked, which is a silent correctness bug
rather than a syntax error. The block-as-argument form keeps `lock` and
`unlock` around the block because the block is the macro's own statement. Use
`@sync(val, { ... })`.

The block-as-argument spelling is accepted. The `@sync(val, { ... })` form is
the shipped spelling for the synchronization sugar, and no parser change is
wanted for it. The trailing-block form stays out of scope.

Zith-- macros are not variadic. The arity check requires exactly as many
arguments as declared parameters, so a macro cannot accept a trailing list of
arguments. The fixed-arity macro `raw macro destroy(a: identifier,
b: identifier)` can already expand `@destroy(vec, arena)` into two method
calls, even when the receiver types differ. Macros with the same name cannot
currently be overloaded by arity, so a family of fixed-arity `destroy` macros
is not a scalable substitute.

The intended cleanup may need to be deferred rather than performed at the
macro call. A raw macro that itself expands to `defer { a.destroy(); }`
registers that defer at the expansion boundary, so it runs before execution
continues after the macro call. To defer cleanup until the caller's lexical
block exits today, put the ordinary fixed-arity macro call inside an explicit
defer block:

```zith
defer { @destroy(vec, arena); }
```

This form was verified to read both values before leaving the block and destroy
them on block exit. A future `@destroy(vec, arena)` that registers cleanup by
itself would need a macro/runtime rule that attaches the generated defer to the
caller's lexical block instead of the macro expansion boundary.

Adding macro variadics is possible but is a compiler feature, not a library
one. A heterogeneous call such as `@destroy(vec, arena)` is a good use case:
each argument can have a different type and expand to its own `.destroy()`
method call. The function variadic slice `[...]T` is not equivalent because
all its elements must have the same type.

The macro feature needs a rest parameter that captures the trailing arguments,
an arity rule that permits the tail, and an explicit repetition form in the
macro body that emits statements once per captured argument. The body is an
ordinary block today, so it has no repetition syntax. `..` is `PipeCurrent`
inside a pipeline and a range operator elsewhere, not a general spread. The
repetition must also define source-order expansion and whether an empty tail is
allowed. No syntax or behavior is decided here, and this feature remains out
of scope for `soon/thread`. If the macro means deferred destruction, its
contract must also state which lexical block owns the cleanup registration.

A macro can be exported with `pub` and called through a module alias, so
`@share.sync(val, { ... })` works when the macro is public in the imported
module. The sugar can therefore live beside `Share` in a `soon/thread/share`
module and still read as a call on the share surface.

## Errors

`ThreadError` is an enum with named variants. The first variants are
`Unsupported`, for a backend that cannot start a thread, and `Revoked`, for a
failed `Revokable` access. Thread creation errors are separate from the entry's
own result, so a failing entry still returns through `merge` as its own
`Result`, not as a `ThreadError`.

## Non-goals

- Does not add `fork`, `merge`, `revoke`, or `spawn` as compiler keywords. The
  library `spawn` builds a blueprint and the library `merge` is a method.
- Does not add ownership or type-system rules for threads. Zith-- stays on the
  normal runtime path.
- Does not add closures or captures. Launch arguments are explicit.
- Does not define VM v2 or WASM thread execution. Those backends report
  `ThreadError.Unsupported` until a runtime exists.
- Does not define the executor, task, or non-blocking I/O surface. That is the
  `soon/io` drawing, which builds on this module.
- Does not define a bounded launch, its completion rule, or its resource
  release in the first cut.
- Does not promise cross-backend scheduling or affinity guarantees.

## Open decisions

- The exact spelling of `spawn`, `Job`, `ThreadHandle`, and the context type,
  and whether `spawn` is a method on the backend or a free function.
- Whether the entry is a bare function value, a small entry struct, or a
  state-machine value, and how the context type is declared and constrained.
- The method set of the monitoring handle and how it observes completion
  without consuming a result.
- Whether an explicit `detach()` method exists, or detach stays implicit only.
- Whether the first cut ships a bounded launch beside `unbounded`, and the
  bounded completion and resource-release rules.
- The concrete `Share<T>` and `Revokable<T>` method contracts and how the owner
  revokes and waits for acknowledgement.
- The full `ThreadError` variant list and which variants each backend returns.
- How `soon/thread` starts a real thread on native, VM v2, and WASM, and what
  `c/thread.<os>.zith` exposes as raw externs.
- Whether the synchronization sugar lives in `soon/thread` or beside `Share` in
  a `soon/thread/share` module. Its spelling is settled as
  `@sync(val, { ... })`, and a public macro called through a module alias is
  possible, so `@share.sync(val, { ... })` is expressible.
