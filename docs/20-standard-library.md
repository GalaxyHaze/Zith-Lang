## 20. Standard Library

> **Implementation status:** `stdlib/c/io.zith`, `stdlib/std/io/console.zith`, and
> `stdlib/std/alloc.zith` are the shipped modules. `puts`, `println`, and raw allocator
> primitives work. `stdlib/std/new.zith` is a proposed API draft and is not part of

`std`/`soon` remain documentation-only in this iteration. No existing module is being rewritten.
The documented convention uses resource types with `init`/`destroy`, read-only methods with
`view`, and mutating methods with `lend`. `defer` runs `destroy(self: lend Self)` on resource
cleanup. `drop` remains outside the `Zith--` subset.

### 20.1 Three-Part Structure

| Namespace | Stability | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `std` | Stable, backward-compatible | You need a guaranteed API |
| `soon` | Experimental, may change | You're prototyping and don't mind breakage |
| `c` | Direct C FFI bindings | You need to call C APIs |

```zith
import std;
import soon;   // use with caution — API may shift
import c;       // raw C bindings
```

### 20.2 Core Modules

#### `std/io/console`
```zith
fn println(msg: []char): void;
fn print(msg: []char): void;
fn eprint(msg: []char): void;
```

The console module also provides `input()` as the owning line-input
constructor. `InputLine` owns its buffer and exposes `text`, `len`, `good`,
`cast<T>`, and `destroy`. Callers must destroy the line after use.

`ParseInput` is the parsing contract implemented by the primitive numeric and
boolean types shipped with the standard library:

```zith
pub trait ParseInput {
    fn parse(self: view InputLine): ?Self;
}
```

`InputLine.cast<T: ParseInput>` returns `?T` without destroying the line.
Passing `view line` preserves the owner for later use:

```zith
let n = line.cast<i32>();
```

`i32`, `bool`, `f32`, `f64`, and `u32` implement `ParseInput` in the current
stdlib surface. `*char` parsing remains out of scope.

```zith
@println("hello");
```

#### `std/alloc`

Raw storage primitives and a default heap allocator. The trait methods use
`self` read-only receivers because the current compiler invalidates a concrete
receiver after a trait method call in the same scope. The `dyn Allocator`
free functions are the supported repeatable call path.

```zith
pub trait Allocator {
    fn alloc(self, size: u64, align: u64): ?raw opaque;
    fn free(self, mem: raw opaque, size: u64, align: u64);
    fn realloc(self, old: raw opaque, old_size: u64, old_align: u64,
               new_size: u64, new_align: u64): ?raw opaque;
}

pub struct HeapAllocator {}

pub fn allocate(self: dyn Allocator, size: u64, align: u64): ?raw opaque;
pub fn deallocate(self: dyn Allocator, mem: raw opaque, size: u64, align: u64);
pub fn reallocate(self: dyn Allocator, old: raw opaque, old_size: u64,
                  old_align: u64, new_size: u64, new_align: u64): ?raw opaque;
```

`allocate` returns `null` when the underlying `malloc`/`realloc` call fails.
The caller owns the storage and must pass the same `size`/`align` to
`deallocate`. The larger `InPlace`/`new`/`delete`/`make`/`release` contract is
recorded in [ADR 0010](adr/0010-allocator-inplace-drop.md). A draft module at
`stdlib/std/new.zith` carries the target trait and helper signatures, but it is
marked proposed because the compiler cannot yet instantiate generics that only
appear in the return type or dispatch opaque packs during construction.

#### `std/new` (proposed draft)

```zith
pub trait InPlace {
    fn inplace(var self, allocator: dyn Allocator, args: opaque): bool;
    fn clean(var self, allocator: dyn Allocator) {}
}

pub fn new<T: InPlace>(args: opaque): ?*T;
pub fn delete<T: InPlace>(ptr: *T);

pub fn make<T: InPlace>(allocator: dyn Allocator, args: opaque): ?*T;
pub fn release<T: InPlace>(allocator: dyn Allocator, ptr: *T);
```

This module is intentionally not wired into `test-examples` until the
compiler supports the API. It stays as the single stdlib location for the ADR
contract so the larger ownership/allocator work has a concrete target.

#### `std/collections/DynArray`

```zith
struct DynArray<T> {
    fn push(self: lend, val: T);
    fn pop(self): ?T;
    fn len(self): u64;
    fn get(self, index: u64): ?T;
}
```

#### `std/fs`
```zith
struct File { ... }

fn open(path: string): File!;
fn read(self: view File): []u8!;
fn write(self: lend File, data: []u8): void!;
```

### 20.3 Common Traits

| Trait | What it enables |
|---|---|
| `Copy` | Bitwise copy — primitives and components get this by default |
| `Clone` | `fn clone(self): Self!` |
| `Lent` | Can appear as a `lend` parameter |
| `Share` | Safe to share across threads |
