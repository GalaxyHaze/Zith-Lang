# Introduction

Zith is a statically typed, compiled systems language with a specification that
is ahead of its implementation. The language and compiler are under active
development. Documentation should be treated as draft material, not as a
stability guarantee.

The `main` compiler builds `Zith--`, the implemented subset of the language.
The [English Zith-- reference](doc:zith-subset-reference) is the operational
language for `zithc`. The [Specification](doc:reference-specification)
describes the larger intended language.

## Read the right document

- Start with [Quick Start](doc:getting-started-quick-start) to create and run a project.
- Use the [Language Guide](doc:guide-overview) for short practical explanations.
- Use the [Language Reference](doc:reference-specification) for the canonical specification.
- Use the [English Zith-- reference](doc:zith-subset-reference) for the implemented subset.
- Check [Implementation Status](doc:reference-implementation-status) before relying on a feature.

The `Zith--` compiler currently supports core declarations, bindings, structs
and pointers, the full operator set including compound assignment and bitwise
operators, `when` pattern matching, the `for` family including iterators,
`state`/`dock`/`jump`, generic instantiation, function overloading,
function-pointer values, traits/interfaces and `dyn` method dispatch, macros
and `raw macro`, `raw opaque` handles, `lend`/`view`, modules, and C header
imports. All of it lowers through HIR to LLVM code generation for x86-64 and
WebAssembly. Tag macros parse, but are rejected in the `Zith--` pipeline.

Ownership analysis (NRA) has the `lend`/`view` call-annotation slice but not the
full state machine. Comptime evaluation, `const fn`, async execution, and
context-based extensions remain specification-only. `const fn` and `global`
report `E2010`.
