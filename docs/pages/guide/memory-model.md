# Memory Model

The language separates ordinary values from references into existing storage.
The full Zith design uses Node Resource Analysis (NRA) and the qualifiers
`mut`, `lend`, `view`, `unique`, `share`, and `belong`. Zith-- currently
implements the smaller `lend`/`view` slice.

## Borrowing with `lend` and `view`

`lend T` and `view T` parameters lower to pointers. A `default` binding passed
to a `lend` or `view` parameter requires `lend x` or `view x` at the call site.
Omitting the annotation or using the wrong mode reports `E4005`. The same
binding cannot be lent twice or used as both `lend` and `view` in one call.

Use `view` when the callee only needs to read:

```zith
fn peek(value: view i32): i32 {
    value
}
```

Use `lend` when the callee may write through the reference:

```zith
struct Counter {
    value: i32,
}

fn increment(counter: lend Counter) {
    counter.value = counter.value + 1;
}
```

Bindings with the default ownership mode need an explicit annotation at the
call site:

```zith
var counter = Counter { value: 0 };
increment(lend counter);
```

The annotation states the borrow mode at the boundary. It does not transfer
ownership into the callee.

## Pointers and address-taking

`*T` is a non-nullable pointer object. `?*T` is its nullable form. Taking an
address creates a pointer to the local storage:

```zith
fn readPoint(): i32 {
    var value: i32 = 10;
    let pointer: *i32 = &value;
    *pointer
}
```

The compiler tracks local pointer aliases and rejects pointers that escape
their valid scope. Returning a pointer to a local, storing it in a persistent
aggregate, or placing it in a global is not a substitute for allocating
storage.

## `view` is read-only

A `view` parameter can read its referent but cannot write through it:

```zith
fn readOnly(counter: view Counter): i32 {
    counter.value
}
```

Writing through a `view` is rejected. Use `lend` when the function needs write
access. LLVM emits `nocapture` for borrows and `readonly` for views.

## What is missing

The alive/dead/lent state machine and the rest of the ownership diagnostics
(`E4002` borrow conflict and `E4003` double borrow) are not implemented.
`E4001` is emitted for logical receiver moves after calls that consume a method
receiver. `unique`, `share`, `belong`, and `mut` are rejected with `E2010` in
this subset.

The ownership pipeline boundary is in place. The stable order is
`sema -> comptime/solve -> NTA/NRA -> HIR`. Semantic facts are accumulated and
consumed before final lowering, and residual ownership facts attach to side
tables instead of introducing ownership nodes into HIR.

Read the [Memory Model reference](doc:reference-07-memory-model) for the full
design and [Implementation Status](doc:reference-implementation-status) for
the current boundary.
