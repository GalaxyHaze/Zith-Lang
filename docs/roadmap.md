# Zith Compiler Roadmap

> Derived from [Zith-spec.md](Zith-spec.md) and [impl-status.md](impl-status.md) at baseline
> `bf7925e`. Each feature carries a stable ID (`F-NN`) reused across waves and test suites.

## Wave Groupings

### Wave 02 — Pattern Matching & Control Flow Completion
F-01 (`when` — finish WIP integration), F-02 (`match`), F-03 (`for` iterator/3-clause), F-04 (`dock`), F-05 (`const fn` parse), F-06 (`is <type>`).

Dependencies: none outside the wave.  Max parallelism: 2 agents (F-01/F-02 shared AST; F-03/F-04 independent).

### Wave 03 — Error Handling
F-11 (`fail`/`with`/`catch`/`throw`/`must`), F-12 (`T!` propagation), F-13 (`raw` unwrap).

Dependencies: `?T` and `T!` types already working.  Max parallelism: 2 agents.

### Wave 04 — Comptime
F-10 (`@sizeOf`/`@intrinsic` parse), F-15 (`comptime` blocks), F-16 (`const fn` evaluation), F-17 (reflection intrinsics), F-28 (pack ops).

Dependencies: needs F-05 (`const fn` parsed).  Max parallelism: 2 agents (comptime evaluator + reflection intrinsics).

### Wave 05 — NRA Ownership Analysis
F-14 (`lend`/`view`/`unique`/`share`/`belong` analysis pass), F-27 (destructuring).

The stable HIR boundary is now structural: NTA/NRA facts are accumulated before final lowering and
HIR carries only residual side-table facts. Remaining work is the alive/dead/lent state machine,
the four NRA rule diagnostics, and any further lowering that must preserve qualifier structure
before the proof. Qualifier parsing/typing (F-34) is complete. Max parallelism: 1 agent (single
analysis pass with a tight contract to lowering).

### Completed outside the wave order
F-33 (function overloading) and F-34 (memory qualifier parsing and typing) are implemented.

### Wave 06 — Dynamic Dispatch
F-07 (`dyn Trait`) and the same vtable lowering used by `dyn Interface` are **working**.
F-29 (trait constraints `T: Trait`) is covered by generic constraints.

F-07 now has codegen coverage for nominal traits; interfaces use the same HIR/codegen path.

### Wave 07 — Macros, Words & Contexts
F-08 (`@macro` calls) and F-24 (tag macros) are implemented. Normal macros keep hygiene for template bindings and resolve other names through the call-site scope; raw macros splice literally into the call-site scope with module/global fallback. Remaining work in this wave: F-09 (word call/sequence expressions), F-21 (context semantics), F-22 (`use` semantics), F-23 (word decl semantics), F-26 (`::` scope resolution).

Dependencies: the macro expander is complete; word/context semantics still need F-09 words parsed first.

### Wave 08 — Runtime Concurrency Surface
F-18 (runtime task/coroutine APIs), F-19 (runtime thread/channel APIs), F-20 (NRA facts needed by
those APIs).

Dependencies: F-30 (`stdlib`) plus F-14 (pre-HIR ownership proof). No frontend syntax or HIR node
work is planned here. Max parallelism: 2 agents (runtime surface + ownership integration).

### Wave 09 — Assets & Stdlib
F-25 (assets), F-30 (stdlib), F-31 (union runtime semantics), F-32 (C interop completion).

Max parallelism: 2 agents (assets + stdlib).

### Wave 10 — Scoped Cleanup

F-40 (`defer`) is implemented in `Zith--`: parser, sema, HIR, and codegen
support `defer expr;` and `defer { ... }` with reverse-order cleanup on block
exit, including `return`, `break`, `continue`, and `state` `jump`. F-41
(`drop`) remains pending and will reuse the same scope-cleanup structure to add
the deterministic owner method plus ownership checks. Max parallelism: 1 agent,
because F-41 is a natural extension of F-40 and both touch the same statement
and block-lowering paths.

## Wave 01 (Current Zith--)

Zith--: platform imports (F-42) are implemented as resolver work; `drop`
(F-41) remains the deterministic scope-cleanup completion, followed by
monolith splits and debt closure.
Comptime/introspection/type construction remain full-Zith features and are
archived under `docs/plans/archive/0.7.0-zith/`.

Infrastructure: ZIRL sections, cache hydration, CLI commands (`test`, `deps`, `docs`), diagnostics quality, roadmap, and infra tests.  See [impl-status.md](impl-status.md), [docs/plans/0.7.0/README.md](0.7.0/README.md), and [docs/plans/monolith-splits.md](plans/monolith-splits.md).

## Notes

- Feature IDs are stable and should be referenced in commit messages, test names, and PR descriptions.
- The dependency graph encodes the minimum build order; waves can overlap when dependencies are acyclic.
- The WIP `when` (F-01) is the first item of Wave 02 and remains uncommitted through Wave 01.
